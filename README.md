# My Honeypot

## Purpose
It is difficult to detect any attackers or bots accessing your IP address. As such, I was inspired to create a simple honeypot using Python. This logs the date, time, and address of each time the attacker attempts to log in to my address via port and server number.

## Future Goals

* embed a honeypot on a simple webpage (fake website with exam answers - catch cheaters)
